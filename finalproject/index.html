				The following pages will allow you to interactively explore the opening melodic motif of the jazz standard, 'Willow Weep for Me.' 'Willow' was composed by Ann Ronnel in 1937. Below is an excerpt from <i>The Jazz Standards</i> by Ted Gioia: 
				<div id="blockquote">
					"During her first year at Radcliffe, Ann Ronnel has been struck by the loveliness of the willow trees on campus, and this simple observation served as the impetus for an intricate song. Ronnel took 'Willow Weep for Me' to Irving Berlin's publishing company, but Berlin's associate Saul Bornstein expressed sharp criticism of the pieceâ€”especially its rhythmic complexity and its dedication to George Gershwin. But when Irving Berlin himself heard the song, he was enthusiastic... despite all the criticisms, Ronnel's melody captures the attention from the start with a very unusual octave leap downward in the opening bar, a vertiginous plunge followed by a reassuring triplet bounce unlike anything else in the jazz repetoire of the era."

				<br>
				You can explore that 'vertiginous' octave leap (plus a few more notes) on the <i>Melody</i> page. On this page you can hear the first five notes of the melody by clicking on the circles (from left to right to hear them in order). Then on the <i>Harmony</i> page you can hear the notes of the melody along with the chords underneath them. Lastly, on the <i>Chord Tones</i> page you can hear what notes make up those chords and see how they relate to the melody itself; the first 3 squares make up the first chord which is C major triad, and the last 3 squares make up the second chord which is a G major triad altered to have a sharp fifth, a G(#5) chord.
