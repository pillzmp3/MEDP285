			<h3>from <i>The Secret Lives of Color</i> by Kassia St. Clair:</h3>

				"Malaria was rife in Europe during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In the 1740s Horace Walpole wrote, with the preoccupation typical of a beleaguered tourist, of 'a horrid thing called the <i>mal'aria</i> that comes to Rome every summer and kills one.' Half of all the patients admitted to St. Thomas's Hospital in London in 1853 were diagnosed with ague, or malarial fevers.

				Quinine, the only known treatment, was extracted from the bark of a particular South American tree and cost a fortune: the East India Company spent around $123,000 on it annually. The financial incentives for synthesizing quinine were obvious. It was partly these, and partly a love of chemistry for its own sake, that drove an 18-year-old scientist to spend his holidays holed up in a makeshift laboratory in his father's East London attic, trying to synthesize quinine from coal tar. Today William Perkin is celebrated as one of the heroes of modern science. It is not because of quinine, which he never did manage to produce, but because of a rich seam of chemistry that he opened up when he accidentally happened upon a particular shade of purple: mauve."

				"Contusions and confusions. Half-mourning and melancholia. Twilight and adolescence, home decorators and homosexuals. Drag queen hair, cheap swag, braggadocio. Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley (that 'monstrous orchid,'' said Wilde). Orchids, especially Cattleya labiata. All things orchidaceous, including the word “orchidaceous.” Prose just shy of purple. According to Nabokov, time itself."

			"One does not necessarily think of a color as a commodity. Colors, the ancients reasoned, are qualities of objects, or our eyes’ subjective response to those objects, not entities in themselves. They tinge and dapple and pass on. Nonetheless, some ancients paid high prices for one color: purple. So 'Tyrian purple' is the name Perkin gives his new hue, referencing the dye eked out of the glandular secretions of tiny, spiny sea snails in ancient Tyre to color the imperial robes of Rome. But real Tyrian purple was the near-black of dried blood. What’s more, Perkin’s color is cheap, but that’s mauve for you, the color of ostentation. The name doesn’t take. Instead, mauve gets its name from a French flower, the one the English call mallow."
